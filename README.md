# Titanic Survival Analysis & Visualization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** of the Titanic dataset, completed as part of an **internship task**. The goal is to understand survival patterns by analyzing passenger attributes such as gender, class, and age, while practicing data cleaning and visualization techniques.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Load and inspect the Titanic dataset
* Identify missing values and data types
* Clean the dataset by handling missing data
* Analyze survival rates by:

  * Gender (Sex)
  * Passenger Class (Pclass)
  * Age groups (Age buckets)
* Visualize insights using charts
* Summarize findings in a short insight report

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

* Dropped the **Cabin** column due to excessive missing values
* Filled missing **Age** values using the median
* Filled missing **Embarked** values using the mode

---

## 📊 Analysis & Visualizations

The following visualizations were created:

* **Bar Chart**: Survival rate by gender
* **Bar Chart**: Survival rate by passenger class
* **Violin Plot / Box Plot**: Age distribution by survival status

These charts help highlight patterns and differences in survival probabilities.

## 📝 Key Insights

* Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate than males
* First-class passengers were more likely to survive than those in lower classes
* Children showed better survival chances compared to adults
* Survival probability decreased with increasing age
* Gender and passenger class were strong indicators of survival
